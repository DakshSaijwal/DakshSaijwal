# Hi, I’m Sage 👋

I’m a student interested in **Machine Learning and Data Structures & Algorithms**, currently building a strong foundation for **ML and SDE roles**, with a long-term interest in **research-oriented internships and academia**.
Undergraduate student at IIT Kanpur.
I like working on problems where the data is imperfect, assumptions break, and careful reasoning actually matters.

## 🧭 Current Focus

- Strengthening problem-solving and **DSA using C++**
- Building **end-to-end ML projects** with clean preprocessing and honest evaluation
- Understanding *why* models work, not just how to train them

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🌫️ Delhi AQI Index Prediction  
**Spatio-Temporal Air Quality Forecasting using Machine Learning**

My first full-scale ML project, focused on predicting major air pollutants in Delhi using station-level data.

**What makes this project meaningful to me**
- Real-world data preprocessing with severe missingness
- Hybrid imputation strategy:
  - Linear interpolation for short gaps
  - Kalman filtering for medium temporal gaps
  - Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) for long spatial gaps
- Time-aware feature engineering (lags, rolling windows)
- Leakage-safe, time-based train–test evaluation
- Strong predictive performance using tree-based models

**Tech & Tools**
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, Kal
- Matplotlib for analysis and visualization

## 🧠 How I Think About ML

- Data quality and preprocessing matter more than fancy models
- Model accuracy is meaningless without correct validation
- Time series problems deserve respect for causality and temporal order
- Learning is iterative — each project should leave you sharper than before
